Paragraph on Pollution 1 (100 Words)
Environmental pollution refers to the presence of harmful and poisonous substances into our environment. It is not only limited to air pollution but can also affect water bodies, soil, forests, aquatic life and all the land living species as well. The main factors leading to environmental pollution are human generated.

Since ages we have been interfering with the environment in order to expand our habitat and to make living easy. Humans have invented automobiles, set up factories, cut down forests to make way for roads and cities – all compromising the environmental health. Inadequate waste disposal and its littering have resulted in polluting our oceans and water bodies, rendering them useless and threatening the life of the species which depend on them.
